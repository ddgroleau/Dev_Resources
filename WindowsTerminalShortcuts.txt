Windows Terminal Keyboard Shortcuts
Following are the Windows Terminal keyboard shortcuts.

Ctrl + Shift + Number: Open new profiles/tabs. Use this shortcut to open a new profile or tab in Windows Terminal. Each number represents a specific profile in the Terminal. Profiles are numbered in the top-down form in the profile selection dropdown menu on the title bar. For example, if the PowerShell profile is in the second position, you should press the “Ctrl + Shift + 2” to open it.

Ctrl + Alt + Number: Switch to a specific tab. Use this shortcut to switch between tabs. Tabs are numbered from left to right and start with “1.” For example, if you want to switch to the third tab, press “Ctrl + Alt + 3.”

Ctrl + Shift + Space: Opens profile selection dropdown menu. You can then use the up/down arrow keys to select and open the profile.

Ctrl + Shift + T: Opens a new tab with the default profile.

Ctrl + Shift + N: Opens a new Windows Terminal instance.
