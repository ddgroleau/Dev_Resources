Debugging

Steps:
1. Identify problem.
2. Explore the simple or "stupid" reasons why this problem may be occurring (i.e user error, syntax/spelling error).
3. Re-create problem. This will get you as close to the error as possible. If problem cannot be re-created, collect error details, screenshots, etc.
4. Create an informed hypothesis, "The problem is caused by X".
5. Create a null hypothesis "The problem is not caused by X".
6. Attempt to reject (prove wrong) the null hypothesis through testing.
7. If you fail to reject the null hypothesis, the issue has been determined. If you can reject the null hypothesis, repeat steps 4-6.

Methodology: 
I use the inverse hypothesis because the problem could be cause by a number of things, and the inverse isolates one causal factor. 
It ensures that the root cause you are testing is truly the root cause and not a red herring.
The rejecting the null hypothesis also forces you to prove that your hypothesis is correct.
